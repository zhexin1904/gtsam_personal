    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `BarometricFactor` (contributed by [Peter Milani](https://github.com/pmmilani) in 2021) provides a way to incorporate altitude information derived from barometric pressure measurements into a GTSAM factor graph. It acts as a unary factor on a `Pose3` state variable but also connects to a `double` variable representing a slowly varying atmospheric pressure bias (or equivalently, an altitude offset).\n",
    "\n",
    "Barometers measure absolute atmospheric pressure. Under the assumption of a standard atmosphere model, this pressure can be converted into an estimate of altitude above sea level. However, local atmospheric pressure changes constantly due to weather, making the direct pressure-to-altitude conversion inaccurate over longer periods. The `BarometricFactor` accounts for this by simultaneously estimating the vehicle's altitude (Z-component of the `Pose3`) and a bias term that absorbs the slow variations in local atmospheric pressure relative to the standard model."

    "## Mathematical Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Pressure to Altitude:** The factor internally converts the input barometric pressure measurement $P_{meas}$ (in kPa) to an altitude estimate $h_{std}$ (in meters) using a standard atmosphere model (approximated by the factor's `heightOut` method, based on [NASA GRC](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/atmosmet.html)). This $h_{std}$ becomes the factor's internal measurement `nT_`.\n",
    "    $$ h_{std} = \\text{heightOut}(P_{meas}) $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Factor Error:** The factor constrains the Z-component of the `Pose3` variable's translation ($p_z$) and the bias variable ($b$). The error is the difference between the altitude predicted by the state and bias, and the altitude derived from the measurement:\n",
    "    $$ e = (p_z + b) - h_{std} $$ \n",
    "    where:\n",
    "    - $p_z$ is the Z-coordinate of the `Pose3` translation.\n",
    "    - $b$ is the estimated altitude bias (in meters).\n",
    "    - $h_{std}$ is the altitude calculated from the pressure measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bias Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "The bias $b$ is typically connected between successive time steps using a `BetweenFactor<double>` with a very small noise model, enforcing that the bias changes slowly over time (approximating a random walk)."
