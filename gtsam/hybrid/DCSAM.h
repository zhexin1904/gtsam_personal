   * variables to those from the last solve and any supplied by the initial

   * 3. For all new discrete-continuous factors to be passed to the continuous
   * solver, update/set the latest discrete variables (prior to adding).
   *
   * 4. In one step: add new factors, new values, and earmarked old factor keys
   * to iSAM. Specifically, loop over DC factors already in iSAM, updating their
   * discrete information, then call isam_.update() with the (initialized) new
   * DC factors, any new continuous factors, and the initial guess to be
   * supplied.

   * latest information from the continuous solve.
