    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The `LinearContainerFactor` class in GTSAM is a specialized factor that encapsulates a linear factor within a nonlinear factor graph. This is used extensively when marginalizing out variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Encapsulation of Linear Factors**: The primary function of the `LinearContainerFactor` is to store a linear factor and its associated values, enabling it to be used within a nonlinear context.\n",
    "- **Error Calculation**: It provides mechanisms to compute the error of the factor given a set of values.\n",
    "- **Jacobian Computation**: The class can compute the Jacobian matrix, which is essential for optimization processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LinearContainerFactor**: This constructor initializes the `LinearContainerFactor` with a linear factor and optionally with values. It serves as the entry point for creating an instance of this class."
